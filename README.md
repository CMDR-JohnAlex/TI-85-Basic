# TI-85 BASIC PROGRAMS

Welcome!

This repository is a collection of the programs I made on my [Texas Instruments TI-85 Graphing Scientific Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-85) using TI-85 BASIC.

The programs here are unlikely to run on other Texas Instruments calculators however, there are websites with large collections of programs for a large number of Texas Instruments calculators that can be found at [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/).

Some of you may have noticed that the files do not have the file extension of ".85P" or similar, this is because I typed out the code from my TI-85 into a text editor because I do not have one of those link cables. Due to the lack of said cable, I have found it impossible to find any programs for the TI-85 that aren't ".85P" files and that have been typed out, n'or can I find a way to convert those files to text, so this repository will be filled with my programs fully typed out.
