Do not include this text, there are no comments in TI-85 BASIC.

This program "KeyScan" checks all keys to see what key is being
pressed. This is useful since I have no idea what the key
values are for all the buttons. The program displays the
keycode for the first button it finds being pressed.

I typed this program up and used → as the character for the
button that looks like "STO⊳"
